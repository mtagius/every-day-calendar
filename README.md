# every-day-calender

This project is a quick stab at making a web version of [Simone Giertz's Every Day Calendar](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/simonegiertz/the-every-day-calendar).  Simone's Calender is a calender that motivates you to complete a daily task by showing you all of the previous days you have completed that task.

I absolutely love her design because it shows every day of the year and I couldn't wait to make my own version.
